      <h1>Picking an Epicodus track</h1>
      <p class="body">We heard you're considering signing up to study with Epicodus? That's great-we're excited to have you!</p>

      <p class="body">The first thing you need to need do is pick a language. While all our tracks start with an Intro to Programming section, after that each track will spend the rest of their time focusing on a particular language. If you're not sure which to choose, you're not alone! Many prospective students have trouble figuring out which one is right for them.</p>

      <p class="body">Answer the questions below and we'll suggest the best language for you!</p>
